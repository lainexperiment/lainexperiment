/**
 * <pre>{@code
 * 
 * Date: 14/11/2020
 * 
 * The OLX Challenge
 * Problem: Task 1 Multivitamin
 * Status: correctness 87%
 * 
 * Problem
 * 
 * Rick is really fond of fruit juices, but he is bored of their traditional
 * flavours. Therefore, he has decided to mix as many of them as possible to
 * obtain something entirely new as a result.
 * 
 * He has N glasses, numbered from 0 to N-1, each containing a different kind
 * of juice. The J-th glass has capacity[J] units of capacity and contains
 * juice[J] units of juice. In each glass there is at least one unit of juice.
 * 
 * Rick want to create a multivitamin mix in one of the glasses. He is going
 * to do it by pouring juice from several other glasses into the chosen one.
 * Each of the used glasses must be empty at the end (all of the juice from
 * each glass has to be poured out).
 * 
 * What is the maximum number of flavours that Rick can mix?
 * 
 * - N is an integer within the range [2..100,000];
 * - each element of arrays juice, capacity is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000];
 * - arrays juice and capacity have the same length, equal to N;
 * - for each J juice[J] â‰¤ capacity[J].
 * 
 * Sample Input
 * 
juice = [1, 1, 5]
capacity = [6, 5, 8],
 * 
 * Sample Output
 * 
3
 * 
 * Rick can mix all juices in the 2nd glass.
