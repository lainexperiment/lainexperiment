 * The Silver Challenge 
 * Problem: Task 1 Rectangles Strip
 * Status: 70% TIMEOUT ERROR ( 0.132 sec., time limit: 0.100 sec.)
 * 
 * Problem
 * 
 * There are N rectangles numbered from 0 to N-1. The K-th rectangle has size A[K] Ã— B[K].
 * 
 * We want to arrange as many rectangles as possible into a strip. The rectangles can be
 * arranged into a strip if they all share a side of the same length (which becomes the
 * height of the strip). Note that rectangles can be rotated.
 * 
 * Write a function:
 * 
 *     class Solution { public int solution(int[] A, int[] B); }
 * 
 * that, given two arrays A and B of N integers each, returns the maximum number of
 * rectangles that can be arranged into a strip.
 * 
 * Examples:
 * 
 * 1. Given A = [2, 3, 2, 3, 5] and B = [3, 4, 2, 4, 2], the function should return 3.
 * Choosing the 0th, 2nd and 4th rectangles we can obtain the strip of height 2 (note
 * that the 0th rectangle is rotated).
 * 
 * We can also choose the 0th, 1st and 3rd rectangles to obtain a strip of height 3.
 * Here we have rotated 1st and 3rd rectangles.
 * 
 * 2. Given A = [2, 3, 1, 3] and B = [2, 3, 1, 3], the function should return 2.
 * We can choose the 1st and 3rd rectangles.
 * 
 * 3. Given A = [2, 10, 4, 1, 4] and B = [4, 1, 2, 2, 5], the function should return 3.
 * We can choose the 0th, 2nd and 4th rectangles to obtain a strip of height 4.
 * 
 * Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
 * 
 * - N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
 * - arrays A and B both consist of N integers;
 * - each element of arrays A, B is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000].
 *
