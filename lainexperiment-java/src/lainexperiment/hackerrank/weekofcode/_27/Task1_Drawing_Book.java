/**
 * <pre>{@code
 * 
 * Date: 19/12/2016
 * 
 * Hacker rank
 * Week of code 27
 * Problem: Drawing Book
 * Status: accepted
 * 
 * Brieâ€™s Drawing teacher asks her class to open their n-page book 
 * to page number p. Brie can either start turning pages from the 
 * front of the book (i.e., page number 1) or from the back of the 
 * book (i.e., page number n), and she always turns pages one-by-one 
 * (as opposed to skipping through multiple pages at once). When she 
 * opens the book, page 1 is always on the right side.
 * Each page in the book has two sides, front and back, except for 
 * the last page which may only have a front side depending on the 
 * total number of pages of the book (see the Explanation sections 
 * below for additional diagrams). 
 * Given n and p, find and print the minimum number of pages Brie  
 * must turn in order to arrive at page p.
 * 
 * Input Format
 * 
 * The first line contains an integer, n, denoting the number of pages 
 * in the book.
 * The second line contains an integer, p, denoting the page that Brie's 
 * teacher wants her to turn to.
 * 
 * Output Format
 * 
 * Print an integer denoting the minimum number of pages Brie must turn 
 * to get to page p. 
 * 
 * 
 * Sample Input
